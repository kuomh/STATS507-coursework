# Final Project for STATS 507 â€“ Data Science Analytics using Python

This repository contains the final project for STATS 507. The project demonstrates two independent analyses using Python, focusing on both basic statistical analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The work aligns with the course goal of applying practical data science tools using Python and Hugging Face resources.

## Contents

1. `Final_Project01_basic_statistics_analysis.ipynb`  
   Exploratory data analysis and basic statistical summaries were performed on the selected dataset. This notebook demonstrates techniques such as:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Grouped comparisons
   - Correlation and visualizations

2. `Final_Project02_NLP_feature_analysis.ipynb`  
   This notebook focuses on natural language processing, including feature extraction from text data and a simple classification task. Methods used include:
   - Text cleaning and tokenization
   - TF-IDF vectorization
   - Basic modeling using scikit-learn
